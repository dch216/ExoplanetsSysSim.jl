This folder contains example applications of ExoplanetsSysSim - some are fully functional while others are works in progress.

Working:
abc                 = Run a full ABC simulation with basic ExoplanetsSysSim providing the model.
basic               = Run multiple test scripts to test functionality of ExoplanetsSysSim and ABC.
hsu_etal_2018       = Run full ABC simulations to produce the results of Hsu et al. (2018).
dr25_gaia_fgk       = Run full ABC simulations to produce the results of Hsu et al. (2019).

In-Progress:
clusters            = Developing model using clusters for period ratio studies
multiplanet_systems = Developing models for characterizing multiplanet systems
parallel            = Developing structures for utilizing parallel processing

Do Not Touch:
broken              = Abandoned examples
